Food is an important substance for human organism. It mainly consists of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Besides these three nutritive materials, food can also be nodivided into 2 groups - meals of plant origin and meals of animal origin.
The first group (plant meals) is everything that grows out of our earth. First of all these are vegetables. Vegetables have a tiny amount of calories and are very rich in fiber. Certainly fruit is there where vegetable is. Comparing with veggies, fruit is more dangerous for one's figure, because any fruit is primarily a carbohydrate product. In this respect an intake of fruits doesn't have to exceed 500-700 grams per day. Any seeds are also included in our list - legumes and cereals.
The second group (animal meals) is all elements of our nutrition, which are obtained directly from animals. What do animals give us? For the most part it's milk and eggs. Consequently all dairy products turn to be animal food automatically, that is - cheese, curds, ryazhenka (boiled fermented milk), kefir, organic yoghurts and so on. Honey also takes place in this list as well as meat (beef, veal, pork) and meal products (sausages, cutlets).
The most wholesome food is the food from the first group. The thing is, nourishment like that suits all people - the sick, the healthy, the little and the old. Nonetheless, the second group won't do harm to healthy people too, especially if it's not consumed in a processed form.
